Welcome to the Piranha documentation!
=====================================

Piranha is a computer-algebra library for the symbolic manipulation of sparse
multivariate polynomials and other closely-related symbolic objects
(such as Poisson series).

Piranha is written in modern C++, with an emphasis on portability, correctness
and performance. Piranha includes a set of bindings for the Python programming
language, called **Pyranha**, that allows to use the library in an interactive
way.

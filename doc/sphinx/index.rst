Welcome to the Piranha documentation!
=====================================

Piranha is a computer-algebra library for the symbolic manipulation of sparse
multivariate polynomials and other closely-related symbolic objects
(such as Poisson series).

Piranha is written in modern C++, with emphasis on portability, correctness
and performance. Piranha also includes a set of optional bindings for the
Python programming language, called **Pyranha**, that allow to use the
library in an interactive way.
